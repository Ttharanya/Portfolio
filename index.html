  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    I was born in Coimbatore and currently reside in Tiruppur. I completed my SSLC and Higher Secondary Education at Thirumurugan Matric Higher Secondary School, scoring 94% in SSLC and 84% in HSE. Presently, I am pursuing a B.Tech in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science at Erode Sengunthar Engineering College, with a current CGPA of 8.75.

I am highly passionate about front-end development, and I also have a keen interest in Database Management Systems. I actively participate in college events and have secured 2nd place in the Science Expo with a team cash prize of ₹2000, and 4th place in the Innovative Idea Presentation, both as part of team efforts.

To enhance my technical skills, I have completed certifications in Software Engineering (NPTEL – 54%) and Basics of Python (Cybernaut). My ultimate goal is to develop innovative projects that create a meaningful impact on people’s lives.
